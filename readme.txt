# Project #1
We will be learning crating an HTML webpage displaying recipes and images.
We will also be using a numberous amount of skills such
    Creating a git and linking it to github repository 
    Creating a boilerhead
    Creating a list using bullet points indicating steps, and numbered points indicating steps on how to make the recipes
    Attaching images to the page to show what the finished product looks like
    And make it as clean as possible by creating numerous different directories to keep it together
    Execute all commands without looking back as much as possible.
